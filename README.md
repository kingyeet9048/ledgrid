# FULL STACK PROJECT

# DESCRIPTION
This is a basic full stack project. That sends information REST API infomation over to a specific IP address. The system also logs certain information into the Datbase. This is for beginners who want to know more about a full stack project with PHP, HTML, CSS, JS, and MYSQL. This is by no means perfect or production ready. Any contributions are welcome. Just submit a pull request.

# Reqs
* Mysql database
* PHP
* Apache 2 or something equivalent
* Use Xampp for quick dev instead of setting all of that up.
